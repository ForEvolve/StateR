# StateR

StateR (staÂ·tor) is a simple DI-oriented Model-View-Update (MVU) **experiment** using C# 9+.

It works with Blazor and [MobileBlazorBindings](https://github.com/xamarin/MobileBlazorBindings),
including sharing states between the Xamarin part and the Blazor part of a hybrid mobile app.
It should also work with any other .NET stateful client model.

> As of 2021-04-08, the project does not support .NET Standard 2.0, only .NET 5+

This project uses:

-   C# 9 record classes to ensure immutability and to simplify updaters.
-   Dependency Injection to manage states (and everything else)

# Counter sample

The following snippet represents a feature surrounding a counter, where you can `Increment`, `Decrement`,
and `Set` the value of the `Count` property of that `Counter.State`. The snippet also includes the
`InitialState` of that counter.

```csharp
var appAssembly = typeof(App).Assembly;
builder.Services
    .AddStateR(appAssembly)
    .AddAsyncOperations() // [optional] Add support for Redux thunk-like helpers
    .AddReduxDevTools() // [optional] Add support for Redux DevTools
    .Apply()
;
```

```csharp
using StateR;

namespace BlazorMobileHybridExperiments.Features;

public class Counter
{
    public record State(int Count) : StateBase;

    public class InitialState : IInitialState<State>
    {
        public State Value => new(0);
    }

    public record Increment : IAction;
    public record Decrement : IAction;

    public class Updaters : IUpdater<Increment, State>, IUpdater<Decrement, State>
    {
        public State Update(Increment action, State state) => state with { Count = state.Count + 1 };
        public State Update(Decrement action, State state) => state with { Count = state.Count - 1 };
    }
}
```

Then, from a Blazor component that inherits from `StatorComponent`, we can dispatch those actions.

```csharp
@page "/counter"
@inherits StateR.Blazor.StatorComponent
@inject IState<Features.Counter.State> CounterState

<h1>Counter</h1>
<p>Current count: @CounterState.Current.Count</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="@(async () => await DispatchAsync(new Features.Counter.Increment()))">+</button>
<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="@(async () => await DispatchAsync(new Features.Counter.Decrement()))">-</button>
```

> It is not needed to inherit from `StatorComponent`, a component (or any class) can manually subscribe to any `IState<T>`.

To make your life easier you can also add one or all of the follosing lines to the `_Imports.razor` file:

```
// Omitted using statements
@using StateR
@using StateR.Blazor
```

# The origin

I played around with a few other libraries, and I was not 100% satisfied with how they worked.
So while playing around with MobileBlazorBindings and the new hybrid apps, I found that C# 9 records classes were a great fit for this.
I started experimenting with transforming immutable types (records) and created this project.

## Origin of the name

The name `StateR`, pronounced `Stator`, is inspired by `MediatR` that was initially used under the hood to mediate the commands.

## Definition of a Stator

> The stator is the stationary part of a rotary system [...].
> Energy flows through a stator to or from the rotating component of the system.

# Why Redux?

After hearing about it for years, I read about it and found the concept brilliant, experimented with it, and adopted the idea.

## What is different in this library?

This library is based on the concepts introduced by Redux, but .NET is not JavaScript and
.NET Core is built around Dependency Injection (DI), so I decided to take advantage of that.

There is no type and no real DI in JavaScript, so it makes sense that the folks there did not take that into account when they built Redux.

# Redux DevTools

I based the Redux DevTools implementation on [Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor/blob/master/Source/Fluxor.Blazor.Web.ReduxDevTools/ReduxDevToolsInterop.cs), which is a similar project that I used once.
That helped me lower the implementation time to connect StateR with Redux DevTools; thanks.
